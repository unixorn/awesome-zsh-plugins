## Frameworks

These frameworks make customizing your zsh setup easier.

### [alf](https://github.com/psyrendust/alf)

**Alf** is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for zsh; it's modeled after Prezto and Antigen while utilizing Oh My Zsh under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.

### [ant-zsh](https://github.com/anthraxx/ant-zsh)

**Ant-zsh** is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup.

### [antibody](https://github.com/caarlos0/antibody)

**Antibody** A faster and simpler antigen written in Golang. More details at [http://getantibody.github.io/](http://getantibody.github.io/).

### [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs)

**antigen-hs** is a replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead when starting up the shell. It will automatically clone plugins for you.

### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

**Antigen** is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins and will automatically clone them for you.

### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)

**Dotzsh** strives to be platform and version independent. Some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of zsh, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.

### [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh)

**fresh** is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc) from others into your own configuration files. We also support files such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as Bundler for your dot files.

### [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

**oh-my-zsh** is a community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.

### [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

**Prezto** enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes.

### [pumice](https://github.com/ryutamaki/pumice)

**Pumice** is a lightweight plugin manager for zsh.

### [zeesh](https://github.com/zeekay/zeesh)

**Zeesh** is a cross-platform Zsh framework. It's similar to, but incompatible with, oh-my-zsh. It has a modular plugin architecture making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is designed to be as lightweight as possible.

### [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

**Zgen** is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The goal is to have a minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting. The script generates a static `init.zsh` file which does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your `fpath`. The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with `zgen reset` whenever you update your `.zshrc`. Can load oh-my-zsh compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically clone them for you when you add them to your plugin list.

### [zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh)

**zilsh** is a zsh config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen.

### [zim](https://github.com/Eriner/zim)

**Zim** is a Zsh configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions.

### [zoppo](https://github.com/zoppo/zoppo)

**Zoppo** is the crippled configuration framework for Zsh. As an Italian saying goes: "chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare", we realized we were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled ourselves.

### [zplug](https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug)

**:hibiscus: Zplug** is a next-generation zsh plugin manager.

### [zplugin](https://github.com/psprint/zplugin)

**Zplugin** gives reports from plugin load. Plugins are no longer black boxes, report will tell what aliases, functions, bindkeys, Zle widgets, zstyles, completions, variables, PATH and FPATH elements a plugin has set up. Supported is **unloading** of plugin and ability to list, uninstall, reinstall and selectively disable, enable plugin's completions. Also, every plugin is compiled and the user can control this function. The system does not use $FPATH, it's kept clean!

### [ZPM](https://github.com/horosgrisa/ZPM)

**ZPM** ( Zsh plugin manager ) is a plugin manager for [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) similar to vim-plug. ZPM plugins are compatible with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). ZPM runs on Linux, Android, FreeBSD and OS X.

### [ztanesh](https://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh)

**Ztanesh** aims to improve your UNIX command line experience and productivity with the the configuration provided by the ztanesh project: the tools will make your shell more powerful and easier to use.
