# awesome-zsh-plugins

Collection of ZSH frameworks, plugins, tutorials & themes inspired by the various awesome list collections out there.

## Frameworks

These frameworks make customizing your zsh setup easier.

* [alf](https://github.com/psyrendust/alf) - Alf is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for zsh; it's modeled after Prezto and Antigen while utilizing Oh My Zsh under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.
* [ant-zsh](https://github.com/anthraxx/ant-zsh) - Tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup.
* [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs) - A replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead when starting up the shell.
* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) - Antigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (zsh) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to zsh, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins.
* [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh) - dotzsh strives to be platform and version independent, some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of zsh, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) - A community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, OSX, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, macports, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool so that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.
* [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) - Prezto enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes
* [zeesh](https://github.com/zeekay/zeesh) - Zeesh is a cross-platform Zsh framework. It's similar to, but incompatible with, oh-my-zsh. It has a modular plugin architecture making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is designed to be as lightweight as possible.
* [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) - A lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by antigen, but optimized for speed when starting a new shell. Can load oh-my-zsh compatible plugins and themes.
* [zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh) - A zsh config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen. 
* [zoppo](https://github.com/zoppo/zoppo) - the crippled configuration framework for Zsh. As an italian saying goes: "chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare", we realized we were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled ourselves.
* [ztanesh](https://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh) - Improve your UNIX command line experience and productivity with the the configuration provided by ztanesh project: the tools will make your shell more powerful and easier to use.

Not a framework, but still useful

* [zshdb](https://github.com/rocky/zshdb) ZSH debugger

## Installation

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)

1. Clone new plugins into `.zsh.local/modules`
2. Load the plugin module in `.zshrc`
3. Open a new zsh terminal window or tab

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
2. `git clone repo`
3. add the repo to your plugin list

### [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

1. Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory
2. Add the plugin to your `.zpreztorc` file
3. Open a new terminal window or tab

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zgen load githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in.

## Writing New Plugins

I've documented some recommendations for writing a new plugin [here](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/master/Writing_Plugins.md).
