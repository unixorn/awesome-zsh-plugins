**Alf** is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for ZSH; it's modeled after [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) and [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) while utilizing [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.

### [ansible-role-zsh](https://github.com/viasite-ansible/ansible-role-zsh)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/viasite-ansible/ansible-role-zsh) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/viasite-ansible/ansible-role-zsh)

**ansible-role-zsh** is an ansible role with zero-knowledge installation. It uses [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage bundles and [oh-my-zsh](ohmyz.sh). Can load bundles conditionally. By default it includes the powerlevel9k theme, autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and [fzf-widgets](https://github.com/ytet5uy4/fzf-widgets) and [fzf-marks](https://github.com/urbainvaes/fzf-marks). Fully customizable.

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mattmc3/antidote)
 ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mattmc3/antidote)

**Antidote** is a ZSH plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.

It is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static plugin file that you can include in your ZSH config.

It is written natively in ZSH, is well tested, and picks up where [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) left off.

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/tarjoilija/zgen)
 ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tarjoilija/zgen)

**Zgen is currently not being actively maintained** and I recommend you use the [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) fork instead, which is actively maintained and continues to get new features.

**Zgen** is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen). The goal is to have minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting.

### [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jandamm/zgenom)
 ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jandamm/zgenom)

A lightweight plugin manager for ZSH that is a fork that extends the brilliant [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) and provides more features and bugfixes while being fully backwards compatible.

To keep loading fast during new terminal sessions, `zgenom` generates a static `init.zsh` file which does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your `fpath`.

This minimizes startup time by not having to execute time consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc) during every shell session's startup. The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with `zgenom reset` whenever you update your plugin list in your `.zshrc`.

Zgenom can load [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)-compatible and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)-compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically `git clone` plugins for you when you add them to your plugin list.

### [zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zilsh/zilsh)
 ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zilsh/zilsh)

### [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zdharma-continuum/zinit) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zdharma-continuum/zinit)


**Zinit** is an innovative and probably (because of the Turbo) the fastest plugin manager with support for:

- Turbo mode ‚Äì 80% faster ZSH startup! for example: instead of 200 ms, it'll be 40 ms
- Completion management (selectively disable and enable completions)
- Snippets (‚Üî regular files downloaded via-URL, e.g.: scripts) and through them Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins support (‚Üí low overhead)
- Annexes (‚Üî Zinit extensions)
- Reports (from the plugin loads ‚Äì plugins are no longer black boxes)
- Plugin unloading (allows e.g.: dynamic theme switching)
- `bindkey` capturing and remapping
- packages
- Clean `fpath` (the array `$fpath` is not being used to add completions and autoload functions, hence it stays concise, not bloated)
- Services ‚Üî a single-instance, background plugins
- Also, in general: all the mechanisms from the ZSH Plugin Standard ‚Äì Zinit is a reference implementation of the standard.

The project is very active ‚Äì currently > 3100 commits.

### [zinit-4](https://github.com/psprint/Zinit-4)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/psprint/Zinit-4)
 ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/psprint/Zinit-4)

This is Zinit 4 from the [original author](https://github.com/psprint), who once removed the [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) repository from GitHub. This spawned a community-driven [zdharma-continuum](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum) organization that revived all of psprint's ZSH projects. Its main innovations from the @zdharma-continuum fork are:

- AppImage distribution (release link),
- Action complete ‚Äì press Alt-Shift-A and Alt-Shift-C to complete plugin names and ice modifiers,
- Themes ‚Äì set $ZITHEME to one of default, blue and gold to set a color set to use for Zinit 4 messages,
- New ice `build` which is equivalent of three other ices: `null`, `configure` and `make install` and simply builds the project from sources, with support for autotools/CMake/Meson/Scons.

These are the most visible changes, but there are more (like e.g.: support for compiling with libraries from previously built projects/`$ZPFX`).

**zit** is a plugin manager for ZSH. It is minimal because it implements the bare minimum to be qualified as a plugin manager: it allows the user to install plugins from `git` repositories (and `git` repositories only, that's why the name), source plugins and update them. It does not implement fancy functions like cleanup of removed plugins, automatic compilation of installed plugins, alias for oh-my-zsh/prezto/other ZSH frameworks, building binaries, `$PATH` manipulation and others.

**:zap:Znap** is a light-weight plugin manager & `git` repository manager for ZSH that's easy to grok. While tailored for ZSH plugins specifically, **Znap** also functions as a general-purpose utility for managing `git` repositories.

Znap can:

- Make any prompt appear instantly. Reduce your startup time from ~200ms to ~40ms with just one command.
- Asynchronously compile your plugins and functions.
- Cache those expensive `eval $(commands)`.
- Clone or pull multiple repos in parallel.
- Re-clone all your repos without you having to re-enter them.
- Multi-repo management
- Automatic `compinit` and `bashinit` - you no longer need them in your `.zshrc`, znap will do them automatically as needed.

The minuscule ZSH package manager. No frills, no bloat, just 2 kB of 100% ZSH code, providing complete package management for your ZSH environment.

ZSH package managers are abundant, but most are bloated, slow or have excessive requirements. On top of that, more than a few have been abandoned for years. Zpico does not seek to be the best of the best, rather to balance functionality against a tiny, fast footprint.

## Setups

This section is for full setup dropins - they aren't frameworks, but they're not simple plugins/themes either.

### zgenom

- [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit) - A simple quickstart for using ZSH with [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom). This automatically configures ZSH to use [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) to load a curated (but easily customizable) collection of plugins and periodically automatically update itself, the plugins, and the quickstart kit itself.

### zinit

- [ZPWR](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zpwr) - An extremely powerful custom terminal environment built on top of [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) for maximum speed.  A full terminal configuration framework including `zsh`, `tmux`, `fzf`, `vim` and spacemacs configurations.  It includes:

- 12.9k+ tab completions
- 1.9k+ aliases
- 330+ git aliases
- 400+ zpwr subcommands
- 2.8k functions
- 175+ zpwr environment variables
- 175+ perl, python, bash, ZSH scripts
- 2.8k line README.md
- 50k+ LOC
- 1 line install

## Prerequisites

If you're on a Mac, the `zsh` that comes with it is usually pretty stale. You can use `brew install zsh` to update it.

Many of the themes here use special glyphs for things like displaying a branch icon. You'll need to use a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) or a Powerline-compatible font in your terminal program or you'll see ugly broken boxes where the symbols should be.

## Installation

I recommend [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) if you don't already have a preferred ZSH framework. It adds minimal overhead during shell session startup because it generates a load script only when you change your plugin list, and that load script is sourced during startup instead of being recalculated every time.

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start `zsh`. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH with `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)

1. Clone new plugins into `.zsh.local/modules`
2. Load the plugin module in `.zshrc`
3. Open a new ZSH terminal window or tab

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
2. `git clone repo`
3. Add the repo to your plugin list

### [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

1. Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory
2. Add the plugin to your `.zpreztorc` file
3. Open a new terminal window or tab

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

Zgen is not being actively maintained. I recommend that you switch to the [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) fork, which is.

### [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zgenom load githubuser/reponame` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgenom load` calls in.

Zgenom will automatically clone the plugin repositories for you when you do a `zgenom save`.

### [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zplug "githubuser/reponame"` to your `.zshrc` file.

### [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zpm load "githubuser/reponame"` to your `.zshrc` file.

## Writing New Plugins and Themes

I've documented some recommendations for writing new plugin and themes [here](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/master/Writing_Plugins_and_Themes.md).

There is also a more detailed [Zsh Plugin Standard](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html).
