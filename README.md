## Frameworks

These frameworks make customizing your ZSH setup easier.

You can find some interesting performance timing comparisons of various frameworks in the following locations.

- [rossmacarthur/zsh-plugin-manager-benchmark](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/zsh-plugin-manager-benchmark) - Contains performance benchmarks for the most popular ZSH frameworks, including both install time and load time.
- [pm-perf-test](https://github.com/z-shell/pm-perf-test) - Tooling for running performance tests on multiple ZSH frameworks.

### [alf](https://github.com/psyrendust/alf)

**Alf** is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for ZSH; it's modeled after [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) and [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) while utilizing [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.

### [ansible-role-zsh](https://github.com/viasite-ansible/ansible-role-zsh)

**ansible-role-zsh** is an ansible role with zero-knowledge installation. It uses [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage bundles and [oh-my-zsh](ohmyz.sh). Can load bundles conditionally. By default it includes the powerlevel9k theme, autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and [fzf-widgets](https://github.com/ytet5uy4/fzf-widgets) and [fzf-marks](https://github.com/urbainvaes/fzf-marks). Fully customizable.

### [ant-zsh](https://github.com/anthraxx/ant-zsh)

**Ant-zsh** is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup.

### [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody)

**Antibody** is a faster and simpler [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) written in Golang. More details are available at [http://getantibody.github.io/](http://getantibody.github.io/).

### [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/)

**Antidote** is a ZSH plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.

It is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static plugin file that you can include in your ZSH config.

It is written natively in ZSH, is well tested, and picks up where [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) left off.

### [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs)

**antigen-hs** is a replacement for [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) optimized for a low overhead when starting up a `zsh` session. It will automatically clone plugins for you.

### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

**Antigen** is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (ZSH) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to ZSH, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins and will automatically clone them for you.

### [ax-zsh](https://github.com/alexbarton/ax-zsh)

**Ax-ZSH** is a modular configuration system for ZSH. It provides sane defaults and is extendable by plugins.

**Ax-ZSH** integrates well with [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) and other extensions, including plugins compatible with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

### [deer](https://github.com/ArtixLabs/deer)

A minimalist ZSH plugin manager.

### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)

**Dotzsh** strives to be platform and version independent. Some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.

### [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh)

**fresh** is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc) from others into your own configuration files. We also support files such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as [Bundler](https://bundler.io) for your dot files.

### [miniplug](https://sr.ht/~yerinalexey/miniplug)

**miniplug** is a minimalistic plugin manager for ZSH.

- No crashes or double plugin loading when re-sourcing `.zshrc`
- Unlike other frameworks, Miniplug does not pollute your `$PATH`
- Only does the bare minimum for managing plugins

### [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

**oh-my-zsh** is a community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, `git`, macOS, `hub`, `capistrano`, `brew`, `ant`, macports, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.

### [PMS](https://github.com/JoshuaEstes/pms)

PMS allows you to manage your shell in a way to that helps decrease setup time and increases your productivity. It has support for themes (change the way your shell looks), plugins (adds functionality to your shell), and dotfile management.

The PMS framework also allows you to use the same framework in different shells. Use ZSH on your personal laptop, and use `bash` on remote servers. Wanna try `fish`? Go ahead, try out different shells.

### [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

**Prezto** enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes. There are some [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)-specific plugins at [https://github.com/belak/prezto-contrib](https://github.com/belak/prezto-contrib).

### [pumice](https://github.com/ryutamaki/pumice)

**Pumice** is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH.

### [sheldon](https://github.com/rossmacarthur/sheldon)

A fast, configurable, shell plugin manager.

- Can manage
  - Any `git` repository.
    - Branch/tag/commit support.
    - Extra support for GitHub repositories.
    - Extra support for Gists.
  - Arbitrary remote files, simply specify the URL.
  - Local plugins, simply specify the directory path.
- Highly configurable install methods using [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating.
- Super-fast parallel installation.
- Configuration file using [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax.
- Uses a lock file for much faster loading of plugins.

### [shplug](https://github.com/dtrugman/shplug)

An easy solution for managing your shell environments. Works with both `bash` and `zsh`. Makes it easy to sync your environment across multiple machines with a `git` repository.

### [Toasty](https://github.com/5paceToast/toasty-zsh)

**Toasty** is a ZSH framework made to facilitate management, not dictate it.

### [uz](https://github.com/maxrodrigo/uz)

A ZSH micro plugin manager.

### [yazt](https://github.com/bashelled/yazt)

**Yazt** is a simple ZSH theme manager in maintence that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes, with a few modifications, you can even use it in `bash`.

### [yzsh](https://github.com/yunielrc/yzsh)

**yzsh** is a simple ZSH framework for managing plugins, themes, functions, aliases and environment variables.

### [zap](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap)

**zap** is a minimal ZSH plugin manager.

### [zapack](https://github.com/aiya000/zsh-zapack)

**zapack** is a basic fast minimal ZSH plugin loader.

### [zcomet](https://github.com/agkozak/zcomet)

**zcomet** is a minimalistic ZSH plugin manager that gets you to the prompt surprisingly quickly without caching (see the benchmarks). In addition to loading and updating plugins stored in `git` repositories, it supports lazy-loading plugins (further reducing startup time) as well as downloading and sourcing code snippets.

### [zeesh](https://github.com/zeekay/zeesh)

**Zeesh** is a cross-platform ZSH framework. It's similar to, but incompatible with, [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/). It has a modular plugin architecture making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is designed to be as lightweight as possible.

### [zgem](https://github.com/qoomon/zgem)

**zgem** is a plugin manager for ZSH that supports loading and updating plugins and themes from git, http and local files.

### [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

**Zgen** is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen). The goal is to have minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting. **It is currently not being actively maintained** and I recommend you use the [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) fork instead, which is actively maintained and extended.

### [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)

A lightweight plugin manager for ZSH that is a fork that extends the brilliant [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) and provides more features and bugfixes while being fully backwards compatible.

To keep loading fast during new terminal sessions, `zgenom` generates a static `init.zsh` file which does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your `fpath`.

This minimizes startup time by not having to execute time consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc) during every shell session's startup. The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with `zgenom reset` whenever you update your plugin list in your `.zshrc`.

Zgenom can load [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)-compatible and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)-compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically `git clone` plugins for you when you add them to your plugin list.

### [ZI](https://github.com/z-shell/zi)

**ZI** is a Swiss Army Knife for ZSH. Formerly known as `zplugin` and`zinit`. ZI - [Wiki Pages](https://z-shell.pages.dev/).

Bonus: you can use [zi-console](https://github.com/z-shell/zi-console) to view and change the state of the ZSH session (e.g.: list and unload plugins) and to delete the plugins and snippets from the disk.

### [zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh)

**zilsh** is a ZSH config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen.

### [zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw)

**Zim** is a ZSH configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions.

### [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)

**Zinit** is an innovative and probably (because of the Turbo) the fastest plugin manager with support for:

- Turbo mode ‚Äì 80% faster ZSH startup! for example: instead of 200 ms, it'll be 40 ms
- Completion management (selectively disable and enable completions)
- Snippets (‚Üî regular files downloaded via-URL, e.g.: scripts) and through them Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins support (‚Üí low overhead)
- Annexes (‚Üî Zinit extensions)
- Reports (from the plugin loads ‚Äì plugins are no longer black boxes)
- Plugin unloading (allows e.g.: dynamic theme switching)
- `bindkey` capturing and remapping
- packages
- Clean `fpath` (the array `$fpath` is not being used to add completions and autoload functions, hence it stays concise, not bloated)
- Services ‚Üî a single-instance, background plugins
- Also, in general: all the mechanisms from the ZSH Plugin Standard ‚Äì Zinit is a reference implementation of the standard.

The project is very active ‚Äì currently > 3100 commits.

### [zinit-4](https://github.com/psprint/Zinit-4)

This is Zinit 4 from the [original author](https://github.com/psprint), who once removed the [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) repo from GitHub. This spawned a community-driven [zdharma-continuum](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum) organization that revived all of psprint's ZSH projects. Its main innovations from the @zdharma-continuum fork are:

- AppImage distribution (release link),
- Action complete ‚Äì press Alt-Shift-A and Alt-Shift-C to complete plugin names and ice modifiers,
- Themes ‚Äì set $ZITHEME to one of default, blue and gold to set a color set to use for Zinit 4 messages,
- New ice `build` which is equivalent of three other ices: `null`, `configure` and `make install` and simply builds the project from sources, with support for autotools/CMake/Meson/Scons.

These are the most visible changes, but there are more (like e.g.: support for compiling with libraries from previously built projects/`$ZPFX`).

### [zit](https://github.com/thiagokokada/zit)

**zit** is a plugin manager for ZSH. It is minimal because it implements the bare minimum to be qualified as a plugin manager: it allows the user to install plugins from `git` repositories (and `git` repositories only, that's why the name), source plugins and update them. It does not implement fancy functions like cleanup of removed plugins, automatic compilation of installed plugins, alias for oh-my-zsh/prezto/other ZSH frameworks, building binaries, `$PATH` manipulation and others.

### [zlugin](https://github.com/DrgnFireYellow/zlugin)

**zlugin** is a very lightweight ZSH plugin manager.

### [znap](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap)

**:zap:Znap** is a light-weight plugin manager & `git` repository manager for ZSH that's easy to grok. While tailored for ZSH plugins specifically, **Znap** also functions as a general-pupose utility for managing `git` repositories.

Znap can:

- Make any prompt appear instantly. Reduce your startup time from ~200ms to ~40ms with just one command.
- Asynchronously compile your plugins and functions.
- Cache those expensive `eval $(commands)`.
- Clone or pull multiple repos in parallel.
- Re-clone all your repos without you having to re-enter them.
- Multi-repo management
- Automatic `compinit` and `bashinit` - you no longer need them in your `.zshrc`, znap will do them automatically as needed.

### [zoppo](https://github.com/zoppo/zoppo)

**Zoppo** is the crippled configuration framework for ZSH. As an Italian saying goes: "chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare", we realized we were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled ourselves.

### [zpacker](https://github.com/happyslowly/zpacker)

**Zpacker** is a lightweight ZSH plugin & theme management framework.

### [zpico](https://github.com/thornjad/zpico)

The minuscule ZSH package manager. No frills, no bloat, just 2 kB of 100% ZSH code, providing complete package management for your ZSH environment.

ZSH package managers are abundant, but most are bloated, slow or have excessive requirements. On top of that, more than a few have been abandoned for years. Zpico does not seek to be the best of the best, rather to balance functionality against a tiny, fast footprint.

### [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)

**:hibiscus: Zplug** is a next-generation ZSH plugin manager.

- Can manage everything
  - ZSH plugins/UNIX commands on [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
  - Gist files ([gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/discover))
  - Externally managed plugins e.g., [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) plugins/themes
  - Binary artifacts on [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/)
  - Local plugins
  - etc. (you can add your [own sources](https://github.com/zplug/zplug/blob/master/doc/guide/External-Sources.md)!)
- Super-fast parallel installation/update
- Support for lazy-loading
- Branch/tag/commit support
- Post-update, post-load hooks
- Dependencies between packages
- Unlike [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), no ZSH plugin files (`*.plugin.zsh`) are required
- Interactive interface ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco), [zaw](https://github.com/zsh-users/zaw), and so on)
- Cache mechanism for reducing [the startup time](https://github.com/zplug/zplug#vs)

### [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm)

**zpm** ( ZSH Plugin Manager ) is a plugin manager for [ZSH](http://www.zsh.org/) which combines the imperative and declarative approach. At first run, zpm will do complex logic and generate a cache, after that will only use the cache, so it makes this framework very fast.

- Fastest plugin manager (Really, after the first run, zpm will not be used at all)
- Support for async loading
- Dependencies between packages
- **zpm** runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and Android.
- **zpm** plugins are compatible with [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/).

### [zr](https://github.com/jedahan/zr)

**zr** is a quick, simple ZSH plugin manager written in Rust and easily installable with `cargo install zr`.

### zsh.ai

Focuses on security and hardening of local system. Requires [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

**zshing** is a ZSH plugin manager similar to Vundle/Vim and allows you to...

- Keep track of and configure your plugins right in the `.zshrc`
- Install ZSH plugins
- Update ZSH plugins
- Search by name all available ZSH Plugins
- Clean unused plugins up
- Run the above actions in a *single command*
- Manages the **Source Plugins** of your installed Plugins

### [zsh-dot-plugin](https://github.com/DuckzCantFly/zsh-dot-plugin)

Customize your .zshrc with only ~21 lines of code. Based on [zsh-unplugged](https://github.com/mattmc3/zsh_unplugged).

### [zshPlug](https://github.com/Atlas34/zshPlug)

**zshPlug** is a minimalist plugin manager heavily based on [zap](https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap).

### [ztanesh](https://github.com/miohtama/ztanesh)

**Ztanesh** aims to improve your UNIX command line experience and productivity with the the configuration provided by the ztanesh project: the tools will make your shell more powerful and easier to use.

### [ztheme](https://github.com/SkyyySi/ztheme)

**ztheme** is a small and fast theme engine for ZSH.

### [ztupide](https://github.com/mpostaire/ztupide)

A simple and fast ZSH plugin manager. It uses `zcompile` and async loading to speed up your shell startup time.

### [zulu](https://github.com/zulu-zsh/zulu)

**Zulu** is a environment manager for ZSH 5 or later, which aims to make it easy to manage your shell without writing any code.

- Easily manage your shell environment without editing files.
- Create aliases, functions and environment variables, and have them available to you at the next shell startup.
- Add and remove directories from `$path`, `$fpath` and `$cdpath` with simple commands.
- Install packages, plugins and themes easily, and have them available to you immediately.

## Setups

This section is for full setup dropins - they aren't frameworks, but they're not simple plugins/themes either.

### zgenom

- [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit) - A simple quickstart for using ZSH with [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom). This automatically configures ZSH to use [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) to load a curated (but easily customizable) collection of plugins and periodically automatically update itself, the plugins, and the quickstart kit itself.

### zinit

- [ZPWR](https://github.com/MenkeTechnologies/zpwr) - An extremely powerful custom terminal environment built on top of [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) for maximum speed.  A full terminal configuration framework including `zsh`, `tmux`, `fzf`, `vim` and spacemacs configurations.  It includes:

- 12.9k+ tab completions
- 1.9k+ aliases
- 330+ git aliases
- 400+ zpwr subcommands
- 2.8k functions
- 175+ zpwr environment variables
- 175+ perl, python, bash, ZSH scripts
- 2.8k line README.md
- 50k+ LOC
- 1 line install

## Prerequisites

If you're on a Mac, the `zsh` that comes with it is usually pretty stale. You can use `brew install zsh` to update it.

Many of the themes here use special glyphs for things like displaying a branch icon. You'll need to use a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) or a Powerline-compatible font in your terminal program or you'll see ugly broken boxes where the symbols should be.

## Installation

I recommend [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) if you don't already have a preferred ZSH framework. It adds minimal overhead during shell session startup because it generates a load script only when you change your plugin list, and that load script is sourced during startup instead of being recalculated every time.

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start `zsh`. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH with `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)

1. Clone new plugins into `.zsh.local/modules`
2. Load the plugin module in `.zshrc`
3. Open a new ZSH terminal window or tab

### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)

1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`
2. `git clone repo`
3. Add the repo to your plugin list

### [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

1. Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory
2. Add the plugin to your `.zpreztorc` file
3. Open a new terminal window or tab

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

Zgen is not being actively maintained. I recommend that you switch to the [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) fork, which is.

### [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zgenom load githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file in the same function you're doing your other `zgenom load` calls in.

Zgenom will automatically clone the plugin repositories for you when you do a `zgenom save`.

### [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zplug "githubuser/reponame"` to your `.zshrc` file.

### [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm)

Most of these plugins can be installed by adding `zpm load "githubuser/reponame"` to your `.zshrc` file.

## Writing New Plugins and Themes

I've documented some recommendations for writing new plugin and themes [here](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/master/Writing_Plugins_and_Themes.md).

There is also a more detailed [Zsh Plugin Standard](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html).
